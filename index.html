<p style="width: 500px;"><u>Abstract</u>: This thesis constitutes a description and analysis
of the dialect of the Na (Mosuo) language (Sino-Tibetan/Trans-Himalayan
family) spoken in the village of Shekua. After a brief presentation of
the segmental phonology (consonants and vowels), the main part of the
analysis focuses on the tonal system. Based on previous work and
first-hand immersion fieldwork, it is confirmed that the system is based
on two tonal levels (High and Low). The system is explored in a
systematic manner, starting out from the tones of nouns and progressing
to those of compound nouns, verbs, and various morphosyntactic
constructions. The analysis of the tonal system brings out categories
that can only be revealed by combining information from several
contexts. Seven categories are found for monosyllabic nouns, and no less
than twelve for (monosyllabic) verbs. A contrastive use of the HL
contour, not found among previously documented Na dialects, makes
functional sense inside a two-level system, as it puts the available
phonological units to maximum use. Three-level systems (contrasting H,
M, and L) such as that of the village of Alawa (Yongning) allow for a
wider combinatorial range, and hence are under less pressure to exploit
every nook and cranny of this combinatorial range. This monograph on a
Na tonal system, combined with a fully open access corpus, adds to the
literature on a language whose traditional chain of transmission is
undoubtedly threatened.<br />

<p style="width: 500px;">Since the beginning of my work as a field linguist, I have focused on
the Shekua variety of the Na language, also known as Lataddi Narua.
Shekua is a small village situated in proximity to the Grass Sea, and
the speakers in this village use a variety that is closely related to
Yongning Narua, whose tone system has been described in Michaud (2017).

<h2 class="unnumbered" id="comparative-work-on-na-dialects">Comparative
work on Na dialects</h2>
<p style="width: 500px;">I am currently in the field, collecting data to finalize a study on
tonal correspondences between Yongning Na and Shekua/Lataddi Na. The
study focuses on noun and verb categories in the two dialects. The main
difference between these two dialects lies in their tone systems:
Yongning has a three-level tone system, while Shekua/Lataddi has a
two-level tone system. Lexically, the two dialects are very close, and
moreover, they are mutually intelligible. This pushes for a tonal
comparison: our approach aims to identify precise tonal correspondences
between a two-level system and a three-level system, to potentially shed
light on rearrangement mechanisms. A preliminary study covered 52 verbs
and 51 nouns, and the objective is to expand this dataset to 100 verbs
and nouns for a comprehensive study. The challenge in this task arises
from the <em>morpho-tonological complexity</em> of tonal categories in
Na, which can only be accessed in combination with other morphemes. For
instance, verbs are examined in combination with TAME particles, nouns
within Object-Verb structures and compound nouns.</p>
<p style="width: 500px;">For this study, we utilize carefully curated data and rely on
statistical tools such as Sankey Diagrams and Agglomerative Hierarchical
Clustering. These tools offer evidence-based and interpretable graphs,
contributing to opening discussions on categories. Additionally, the
study draws on first-hand field data, all of which is accessible online
via the Pangloss website.</p>
<p style="width: 500px;">The results of the study mark a first step towards reconstructing the
diachronic processes that led to contemporary Na tone systems.
Simultaneously, a search for cognates is underway between Naish
languages and the conservative languages of the Trans-Himalayan
(Sino-Tibetan) family, particularly Gyalrong languages. This research is
conducted with guidance from Alexis Michaud (<span
class="smallcaps">Lacito</span>) and advice from Guillaume Jacques
(CRLAO). Furthermore, we closely follow the works of Li Zihe (Peking
University), who has undertaken the task of assembling that cognate list
in Naish, Gyalrong, Old Burmese, Old Tibetan and Written Tibetan
languages.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="nlp-for-underdocumented-languages">NLP for
un(der)documented languages</h2>
<p style="width: 500px;">My post-doctoral activities over the past year (and until August
2024) focus on evaluating the deployment cost of NLP methods for
un(der)documented languages. Our work is grounded in the understanding
that the rapid disappearance of rare and undocumented languages poses a
monumental challenge for linguists involved in documenting these
languages. Language models can assist linguists, but since they are
pre-trained on a closed list of resource-rich languages, they need to be
<em>fine-tuned</em> to be able to perform NLP tasks on a language not
seen in pre-training. Before I started this position, a successful
fine-tuning experiment was conducted on Yongning Na (glottocode:
yong1234) and Japhug (glottocode: japh1234), with Word-Error Rates well
within acceptable values for an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task
(Guillaume, Wisniewski, Macaire, et al. 2022a). However, the study
revealed that the quality and diversity of the fine-tuning data impacted
the system’s performance. For instance, a system fine-tuned on
elicitations exhibited poor performance on texts, and vice versa.</p>
<p style="width: 500px;">To better design minimal sets of audio data for input into a language
model, specifically for ASR tasks – such as phonetic and phonological
transcriptions in our case –, my assignment consisted in developing
distance measurement methods in the vectorial representation space. This
allowed us to assess similarities between recordings. With the
assistance of the developed toolkit, our aim is to predict the
performance of a fine-tuning task based on the characteristics of the
input and tested materials.</p>
<p style="width: 500px;">This research is highly interdisciplinary, engaging both NLP
scientists seeking a better understanding of language models based on
neural networks and linguists who stand to benefit from language models
better tailored to their needs. Neural networks are producing
increasingly powerful models for academia, but the process needs to be
better understood, especially by the linguists, who have the expertise
to assess the accuracy of the language models produced recently. The
community can benefit from these models by accelerating time-consuming
stages of work, such as transcription. Thus, it seemed essential to
enter the NLP arena as a linguist. Guillaume Wisniewski (LLF) is the
principal investigator for the project, with a dedicated focus on the
rare languages of Yunnan and Sichuan, leaving ample room for future
collaborations within my area of linguistic interest.</p>
